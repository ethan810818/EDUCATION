I want Code to be a book that makes you understand these things, not in some abstract way, but with a
depth that just might even rival that of electrical engineers and programmers. I also hope that you

and appreciate it as a beautiful thing in itself without metaphors and similes getting in the way.
Computers are constructed in a hierarchy, from transistors down at the bottom to the information
displayed on our computer screens at the top. Moving up each level in the hierarchy—which is how
Code is structured—is probably not as hard as most people might think. There is certainly a lot going
on inside the modern computer, but it is a lot of very common and simple operations.
